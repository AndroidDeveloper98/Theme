# [WIP] Theme

> Q: How to add theme feature to your already amazing Android app to make it more amazing?  
A: Simply tint every view with a color.

So Theme does all those tedious work for you.

**This library is highly inspired and mostly borrowed from [aesthetic](https://github.com/afollestad/aesthetic). You may want to check it first.**

What Theme can do:

- Adds theme feature to an app with minimal code
- Supports any color tint
- No need to create many styles in `style.xml` any more
- Simple and easy to integrate
- Doesn't require too many third-party dependencies
- Support AndroidX

What Theme CANNOT do:

- Change theme dynamically. You'll have to recreate Activity and their back stack.
- Support non-AndroidX project

## Screenshots

Just image your app turns into any color theme.
