# [WIP] Theme

> Q: How to add theme feature to your already amazing Android app to make it more amazing?  
A: Simply tint every view with a color.

So Theme does all those tedious work for you.

**This library is highly inspired by [aesthetic](https://github.com/afollestad/aesthetic) and [Cyanea](https://github.com/jaredrummler/Cyanea). You may want to check them first.**

What Theme can do:

- Adds theme feature to an app with minimal code
- Supports any color tint
- No touches on `style.xml`
- Doesn't require many third-party dependencies
- Supports AndroidX

What Theme CANNOT do:

- Change theme dynamically. You'll have to recreate Activity and their back stack.
- Some views are not supported(TimePicker, etc). I'm still working on it.

## Screenshots

Just image your app turns into any color theme.

## Usage

Check the `app` module.
