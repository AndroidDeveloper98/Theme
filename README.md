# [WIP] Theme

A static theme engine for Android App.

**This library is highly inspired by [aesthetic](https://github.com/afollestad/aesthetic) and [Cyanea](https://github.com/jaredrummler/Cyanea). You may want to check them first.**

However, the mission seems a little complicated using the `View.java` API. I'm deprecating this library in flavor of JetPack Compose which provides dynamic theme support out of the box.
